## Features

Idea: 
Basic concept is much like the TV show. A question is asked, four possible answers are generated and the user picks their answer. As the user progresses, the jackpot amount increases. Player can choose to end game with winnings after each round or continue. There is a time limit on each question and if the player answers incorrectly or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. 

Features:
A name input for the player to personalise the experience.
Require user input for answer responses that are timed.
A range of questions picked at random for individual playthroughs (we donâ€™t want the user to just know all the answers in order)
Answers to change order for each playthrough.
A timer function to encourages quick player decisions.
Keep track of player progress, resets at New Game. - Will redo based on educator suggestions
